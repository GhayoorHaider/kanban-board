## Introduction
Kanban Board is a task management board just like JIRA, Trello, Notion etc.
It lets you create multiple boards and then multiple task lists, You can have your own stream of lists based on your needs. Finally it allows you to create issues / bugs / features and then you can drag these to different tasks lists.

## Why Kanban board?
Being a backend engineer, I always tried to learn frontend and UI/UX just for personal satisfaction, At first, I thought I would go with python as usual and develop something on backend, But then I decided to go with something new and try some frontend project.

## How to use
1. First thing that you need to do is to pull the code and install the required packages using **npm i**
2. Once done, you can run **ng serve** or **npm run start** to start the project, It'll run on port 4200.
3. Go ahead and go the link **http://localhost:4200** and you should be able to use the project.
